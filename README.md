# Clockinout
## I have created a Heroku app [here](https://clockinout.herokuapp.com/)

### A few small notes:
- I created the app using the latest version of Ruby on Rails.
- I quickly added a little aesthetic sugar with Bootstrap, it was the only other Gem I used outside of the default ones.
- I considered modifying the devise gem to work as a time clock or building a Teacher model with a login from the ground up, that way clock in events would be registered to a particular teacher simplifying other features you might want in the future. However this seemed to be outside the parameters of the assignment.
